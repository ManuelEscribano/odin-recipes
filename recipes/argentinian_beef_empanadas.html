    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      My family loves these juicy meat pies with raisins, chopped olives, and
      hard-boiled eggs. This recipe is always a hit.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
      <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped</li>
      <li>14 pitted green olives, such as Manzanilla, finely chopped</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons raisins</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>
        2 (17.5 ounce) packages frozen puff pastry (each with 2 sheets), thawed
      </li>
      <li>1 raw egg, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        Set racks in upper and lower thirds of oven, and preheat to 450 degrees
        F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Cook beef in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat, stirring and
        breaking up lumps, until no longer pink, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer beef
        to a small bowl with a slotted spoon, and pour off grease from skillet.
        Melt butter in skillet and saute onions and green onion, stirring
        occasionally, until tender, about 5 minutes. Return beef to skillet and
        stir in hard-boiled eggs, olives, raisins, cumin, salt, and pepper.
        Transfer mixture to a shallow bowl and chill until cooled, 10 to 20
        minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Brush tops of empanadas with beaten egg. Bake, switching position of
        sheets halfway through, until golden brown, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Unfold 1 pastry sheet, keeping remaining chilled, onto a lightly floured
        surface, dust lightly with flour, and roll out into a 12-inch square.
        Cut 4 (5 1/2-inch) rounds from pastry. Brush a 1/2-inch border around
        edges of 1 round with water, using a small brush or fingertip. Spoon
        about 3 tablespoons of filling onto half of round. Fold other half over
        filling and press edges together firmly. Crimp edges with a fork and
        transfer to one of prepared baking sheets. Repeat with 3 remaining
        rounds. Form 12 more empanadas in same manner with remaining pastry and
        filling, arranging them about 1 1/2 inches apart on baking sheets.
      </li>
